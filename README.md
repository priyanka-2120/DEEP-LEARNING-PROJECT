##This project, undertaken as part of a CODTECH internship, involves the development of a deep learning model using TensorFlow or PyTorch, targeting either image classification or natural language processing (NLP). The objective is to create a functional model capable of accurately classifying input data—images into predefined categories or text into sentiment/meaning-based labels—while providing clear visualizations of the results.

For image classification, the pipeline begins with collecting a labeled dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10 or a custom dataset). A convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed, featuring layers such as convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers, optimized with techniques like dropout and batch normalization to prevent overfitting. The model is trained on preprocessed images (resized, normalized) using a suitable loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy) and an optimizer (e.g., Adam). Performance is evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics on a test set.

Alternatively, for NLP, the project leverages a dataset like IMDB reviews or a custom text corpus. A recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based architecture (e.g., LSTM or BERT-inspired) is implemented. Text data is preprocessed—tokenized, padded, and converted to embeddings (e.g., GloVe or Word2Vec)—before feeding into the model. The model is trained to classify text (e.g., positive/negative sentiment) using binary or multi-class cross-entropy loss.

The implementation, in TensorFlow or PyTorch, emphasizes modularity and scalability. Key deliverables include a trained model, a script for inference, and visualizations such as training/validation accuracy and loss curves (using Matplotlib or Seaborn), confusion matrices, and sample predictions (e.g., classified images or text outputs). For image classification, visualized outputs may include test images with predicted labels; for NLP, sample text with predicted sentiments.
